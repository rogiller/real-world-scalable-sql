						## Real World Scalable SQL

						a real world story about building a scalable data layer

					This talk is on GitHub Pages now!

					[https://rogiller.github.io/real-world-scalable-sql/](https://rogiller.github.io/real-world-scalable-sql/)
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>Where does this story begin?</section>
					<section>Let's talk about Flex4</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Legacy Spring/Hibernate/MySQL application

						started in 2003'ish

						Built rapidly w/o a lot of thought about maintainability
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Large methods & classes (13,000+ line classes!)

						It's worse part is it's immense object graph.
					</section>
					<section>For those unfamiliar with object graphs, let me show you some Flex4 code.</section>
					<section>ProjectElement, ProjectElementLineItem</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>What did this object graph lead to?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Gigantic SQL selects (think 50MB for a single Quote line update).

						N+1 selects (often from lazy loaded collections).
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Impossible Hibernate Collection bugz.

						Database IO counts through the roof.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Database timeout/locks from high load.

						Massive memory usage due to large amounts of data in memory per request.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How did we try to fix it?</section>
					<section>Hibernate 2nd level cache</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						This might have helped, but my gut is that it ended up hurting more than it helped.

						In areas of high churn, you can get a lot of cache misses, leading to even worse N+1 situations.
					</section>
					<section>Hibernate Collection Batching</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						This was probably the most successful performance tweak.

						It helps avoid N+1 selects by loading multiple collections in one database trip.
					</section>
					<section>Native SQL</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Often we just gave up on Hibernate and hand coded SQL.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Ad Hoc Caches in hotspot areas.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Tried to trim down object graph.

						Mostly failed. Ripples out to far.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>What was the solution?</section>
					<section>After much debate, we realized the Flex4 backend was fundamentally unscalable.</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						New Backend Was Needed

						We started a new Spring Boot/Data/Security backend on top of then existing database.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It now works in paralel with the Flex4 backend.

						How we got the two systems to play nice together is a story for another day.

						Spoiler: Just Google "Hazelcast".
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How did we architect the data layer?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We knew Hibernate needed constrained.

						Started with lighter entities with relations pointing
						to an "identity" class to avoid "web out".
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Eventually screwed that and went with
						straight up "row to object" model.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						No @ManyToOne, @OneToMany,
						no collections, nothing.

						Just straight up @Column, period.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Flex5 Entity Example
						```groovy
						@Entity
						@Table(name = Department.TABLE_NAME)
						class Department extends NameAuditEntity implements BusinessModel {
							public static final String TABLE_NAME = "st_biz_department"

							static class COLUMNS {
								public static final String DEPT_NAME = "dept_name"
								public static final String DEPT_CODE = "dept_code"
								public static final String ABBREVIATION = "abbreviation"
								public static final String ACCOUNTING_NAME = "accounting_name"
							}

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.DEPT_NAME, length = 128)
							String name

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.DEPT_CODE, length = 32)
							String code

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.ABBREVIATION, length = 16)
							String abbreviation

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.ACCOUNTING_NAME, length = 128)
							String accountingName
						}
						```
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>Basically nobody does data access right.</section>

				<section>
					<section>sql2o Example</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```java
						public List&lt;Customer&gt; etchCustomers(customerId) {
							try (Connection con = sql2o.open()) {
								final String query =
									"SELECT id, name, address " +
									"FROM customers WHERE id = :customerId";

								return con.createQuery(query)
									.addParameter("customerId", customerId)
									.executeAndFetch(Customer.class);
							}
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Way way to much boilerplate.

						You should NOT need a method body for normal record to POJO. Period.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>JdbcTemplate Example</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```groovy
							List&lt;Permission&gt; findPermissionsForUser(String userId){

								if(StringUtils.isBlank(userId)){
									return Collections.emptyList()
								}

								userId = StringUtils.trim(userId)

								return jdbcTemplate.query('SELECT permission AS name, denied AS denied FROM rh_user_permissions WHERE userprofileid = ?', new RowMapper&lt;Permission&gt;() {
									@Override
									Permission mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
										return new Permission(name: rs.getString('name'), denied: rs.getBoolean("denied"))
									}
								}, userId)
							}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Yuck.

						Repeat after me. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MANUALLY MAP YOUR RESULTS. PERIOD.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>JDBI Example</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```java
						@SqlUpdate("INSERT INTO user(id, name) VALUES (:id, :name)")
						void insertNamed(@Bind("id") int id, @Bind("name") String name);

						@SqlUpdate("INSERT INTO user(id, name) VALUES (:id, :name)")
						void insertBean(@BindBean User user);

						@SqlQuery("SELECT * FROM user ORDER BY name")
						@RegisterBeanMapper(User.class)
						List&lt;User&gt; listUsers();
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Nope still to much boilerplate. `@RegisterBeanMapper(User.class)` makes me shiver.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					So what makes a great data layer tool?


					The absolute minimal boilerplate possible.


					It should allow you to focus on your actual query and almost nothing else.
				</section>

				<section>The tools we picked.</section>

				<section>
					<section>Spring Data</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data was our starter data layer.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It has some really cool abstractions.

						Really good at getting records to/from database.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```groovy
						@Query("SELECT o FROM SalesTaxRuleIdentity AS o ORDER BY o.name ASC")
						List&lt;SalesTaxRuleIdentity&gt; findAllIdentities()

						@Query('''
							SELECT ruleIdentity
							FROM FinancialDocumentDefinitionEnabledSalesTaxRule AS enabledRule
							INNER JOIN SalesTaxRuleIdentity AS ruleIdentity ON ruleIdentity.id = enabledRule.salesTaxRuleId
							WHERE enabledRule.definitionId = ?1
							ORDER BY ruleIdentity.name ASC
						''')
						List&lt;SalesTaxRuleIdentity&gt; findAllIdentitiesEnabledForDefinitionId(String enabledForDefinitionId)
						```
					</section>
					<section>
						What I like?
						- Zero boilerplate.
						- The target entity and it's corresponding property types are just figured out and hydrated.
						- The parameters are just mapped in by ordinal (you can do named ones).
						- You deal at the class level & property level.
						- It's declarative and frickin' readable.
						- The JPQL queries are validated at startup.
					</section>
					<section>
						What I don't like?
						- It's still uses Hibernate under the cover. Meh. Scar tissue.
						- Session cache sucks when you have other data access tools in your app.
						   - e.g. you insert with JOOQ, but JPA doesn't know.
						- You have to explicitly flush for it to go the database (before the transaction ends).
						- Generated SQL output is a bit ugly.
						- You are 1 degree removed from SQL. Which is normally fine, until it isn't.
						  - You want to use a SQL feature JQL doesn't support.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						JOOQ

						[JOOQ website](https://jooq.org)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data has limits in terms of criteria based query building.

						We found JOOQ and fell in love. Er, at least some of us did.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It has a builder pattern that is really powerful, if a bit non-awesome to read.

						Spring Data is our default GOTO until the problem feels like JOOQ land.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```groovy
						List&lt;InventoryGroup&gt; findByParentGroupId(String parentId)  {
							return jooq.select(ID, GROUP_NAME, FULL_DISPLAY_STRING, ICON_ID, MANAGEMENT_GROUP_ID)
								.from(TABLE)
								.where(equalToOrIsNull(PARENT_GROUP_ID, parentId))
								.orderBy(ORDINAL, GROUP_NAME)
								.fetchInto(InventoryGroup)
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section>
						What I like?
						- Powerful builder pattern.
						- Perfect for dynamic queries.
						- Fantastic reusability.
						- Solid POJO mapping abilities (can interpret @Column JPA annotations).
						- Type-safe SQL queries.
					</section>
					<section>
						What I don't like?
						- Hard to read large queries. aka more difficult to maintain.
						- Requires a method body.
						- Probably hard for a junior or new to JOOQ dev to grok.
						- It wants you to use it's "generate jazz" feature which feels really messy.
						  - We didn't. We created our own fields. Which takes up some time.

						Honorable Mentions
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						JDBCTemplate
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data was more powerful and we could do native SQL via it as well.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						myBatis
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Again, Spring Data already solved most of what it brought.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						SQL20

						JDBO
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Probably to immature or not advanced enough.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>Is it working?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						By and large, it's been a huge success in terms of speed.

						We still have to watch out for database round trips.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We'll normally bag up some ID's and fetch all at once, etc.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We use a SPARSE select often.

						We have a bunch of tables that have 100's of columns.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We'll do a sparse "use case select".

						e.g. "findSparseByIdForPrepProcess"
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We use recursive database functions.

						They help us locate id sets for parent/child relation ships.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How does the our data layer translate to JSON?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The beauty of this approach is that we have no domain/DTO translation layer.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The data comes out lean from the database.

						Our entities serialize directly out across the wire.
					</section>
				</section>

					<section>Any questions?</section>
					<section>Thanks for listening!</section>
