						## Real World Scalable SQL

						a real world story about building a scalable data layer
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>Who am I?</section>

						Roger Diller

						I work for Flex Rental Solutions

						been @ Flex since 2009
					</section>

						up the ranks...

						developer, senior developer, technical lead...

						you get the idea.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						now I just harass JC, Matt, Suman, & Bryon about their code

					This talk is on GitHub Pages now!

					[https://rogiller.github.io/real-world-scalable-sql/](https://rogiller.github.io/real-world-scalable-sql/)
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>Where does this story begin?</section>
					<section>Let's talk about Flex4</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Legacy Spring/Hibernate/MySQL application

						started in 2003'ish

						Built rapidly w/o a lot of thought about maintainability
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Large methods & classes (13,000+ line classes!)

						It's worse part is it's immense object graph.
					</section>
					<section>For those unfamiliar with object graphs, let me show you some Flex4 code.</section>
					<section>ProjectElement, ProjectElementLineItem</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>What did this object graph lead to?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Gigantic SQL selects (think 50MB for a single Quote line update).

						N+1 selects (often from lazy loaded collections).
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Impossible Hibernate Collection bugz.

						Database IO counts through the roof.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Database timeout/locks from high load.

						Massive memory usage due to large amounts of data in memory per request.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How did we try to fix it?</section>
					<section>Hibernate 2nd level cache</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						This might have helped, but my gut is that it ended up hurting more than it helped.

						In areas of high churn, you can get a lot of cache misses, leading to even worse N+1 situations.
					</section>
					<section>Hibernate Collection Batching</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						This was probably the most successful performance tweak.

						It helps avoid N+1 selects by loading multiple collections in one database trip.
					</section>
					<section>Native SQL</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Often we just gave up on Hibernate and hand coded SQL.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Ad Hoc Caches in hotspot areas.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Tried to trim down object graph.

						Mostly failed. Ripples out to far.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>What was the solution?</section>
					<section>After much debate, we realized the Flex4 backend was fundamentally unscalable.</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						New Backend Was Needed

						We started a new Spring Boot/Data/Security backend on top of then existing database.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It now works in paralel with the Flex4 backend.

						How we got the two systems to play nice together is a story for another day.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How did we architect the data layer?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We knew Hibernate needed constrained.

						Started with lighter entities with relations pointing
						to an "identity" class to avoid "web out".
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Eventually screwed that and went with
						straight up "row to object" model.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						No @ManyToOne, @OneToMany,
						no collections, nothing.

						Just straight up @Column, period.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Flex5 Entity Example
						```groovy
						@Entity
						@Table(name = Department.TABLE_NAME)
						class Department extends NameAuditEntity implements BusinessModel {
							public static final String TABLE_NAME = "st_biz_department"

							static class COLUMNS {
								public static final String DEPT_NAME = "dept_name"
								public static final String DEPT_CODE = "dept_code"
								public static final String ABBREVIATION = "abbreviation"
								public static final String ACCOUNTING_NAME = "accounting_name"
							}

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.DEPT_NAME, length = 128)
							String name

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.DEPT_CODE, length = 32)
							String code

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.ABBREVIATION, length = 16)
							String abbreviation

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.ACCOUNTING_NAME, length = 128)
							String accountingName
						}
						```

				<section>
					<section>Spring Data</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data was our starter data layer.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It has some really cool abstractions.

						Really good at getting records to/from database.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						JOOQ

						[JOOQ website](https://jooq.org)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data has limits in terms of criteria based query building.

						We found JOOQ and fell in love. Er, at least some of us did.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It has a builder pattern that is really powerful, if a bit non-awesome to read.

						Spring Data is our default GOTO until the problem feels like JOOQ land.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>Is it working?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						By and large, it's been a huge success in terms of speed.

						We still have to watch out for database round trips.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We'll normally bag up some ID's and fetch all at once, etc.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We use a SPARSE select often.

						We have a bunch of tables that have 100's of columns.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We'll do a sparse "use case select".

						e.g. "findSparseByIdForPrepProcess"
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We use recursive database functions.

						They help us locate id sets for parent/child relation ships.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How does the our data layer translate to JSON?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The beauty of this approach is that we have no domain/DTO translation layer.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The data comes out lean from the database.

						Our entities serialize directly out across the wire.
					</section>
				</section>

					<section>Any questions?</section>
					<section>Thanks for listening!</section>
