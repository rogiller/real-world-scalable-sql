						For those unfamiliar what I mean by an object graph....

						Let's look at a Flex4 code example.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>What did an object graph like this lead to?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Absolute out of control SQL.

						I've seen 30MB+ SQL for updating one value on a line item.

						Let's watch a boring video.

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						- N+1 selects (lazy loaded collections**)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>

						- Massive memory spikes (stack objects)
					</section>
					<section>
						What questions do you have about all that context?
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>How did we try to fix it?</section>
					<section data-markdown="">
						Hibernate 2nd level cache
						> it's an "across session cache"
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						This might have helped....

						**my gut is it hurt more than it helped.**

						> Areas of high churn create cache misses, leading to even more N+1.
					</section>
					<section>Hibernate Collection Batching</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The most successful performance tweak.

						> Lowers N+1 selects by loading multiple collections in one database trip.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Seriously, collection batching might be the best tip you take home.

						See [https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/...](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.3/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#fetching-batch).

					<section data-markdown>
						We built Ad Hoc Caches in hotspot areas.

						> But then you get cache eviction issues.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="Without good tests, we can't change the code with confidence.">

                        What questions do you have about taming Hibernate?
                    </section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>What was the solution?</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="Bryon, should we start a new backend?!">
						After much hand wringing...

						**We decided the Flex4 backend was categorically unscalable.**
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="This happened in early Nov 2016.">
						A new backend was needed.

						We started a new Spring Boot/Data/Security backend...

						**on top of the existing database.**

						> this new backend is known as "Flex5"
					</section>
					<section data-markdown
							 data-notes="This allows for parallel systems, and incremental take over from the new system.">
						Our rewrite approach is the "strangler pattern".

						Read [StranglerApplication](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html) for
						more info.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Flex5 is live now and works in parallel with Flex4.

						> How we got the two systems to play nice is a story for another day.

						Spoiler: Just Google "Hazelcast".
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>How did we architect the data layer?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We knew Hibernate needed constrained.

						> We started with lighter entities having ManyToOne relations pointing to lightweight
						"identity" classes to avoid "web out".

						Look at `SoundTheme.groovy`.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						> Eventually scrapped that and went with a straight up "row to object" model.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						No @ManyToOne, @OneToMany, no collections.

						Only @Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Flex5 Entity Example
						```groovy
						@Entity
						@Table(name = Department.TABLE_NAME)
						class Department extends NameAuditEntity implements BusinessModel {

							public static final String TABLE_NAME = "st_biz_department"

							static class COLUMNS {
								public static final String DEPT_NAME = "dept_name"
								public static final String DEPT_CODE = "dept_code"
								public static final String ABBREVIATION = "abbreviation"
								public static final String ACCOUNTING_NAME = "accounting_name"
							}

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.DEPT_NAME, length = 128)
							String name

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.DEPT_CODE, length = 32)
							String code

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.ABBREVIATION, length = 16)
							String abbreviation

							@Column(name = COLUMNS.ACCOUNTING_NAME, length = 128)
							String accountingName
						}
						```

				<section data-markdown data-notes="Sometimes I feel like nobody does data access right...">
					What data layer tools did we end up using?

					Let's first look at tools we didn't pick...
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="Probably the easier to get access to and use for simple stuff.">
						Spring JdbcTemplate

						See [baeldung.com/spring-jdbc-jdbctemplate](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-jdbc-jdbctemplate)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```groovy
						List&lt;Permission&gt; findPermissionsForUser(String userId){

							return jdbcTemplate.query('SELECT permission AS name, denied AS denied FROM rh_user_permissions WHERE userprofileid = ?',
								new RowMapper&lt;Permission&gt;() {
									@Override
									Permission mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
										return new Permission(name: rs.getString('name'), denied: rs.getBoolean("denied"))
									}
								}, userId)
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Ewww.

						**You should NOT have to manually map your DB results.**
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						sql2o Example

						[sql2o.org](https://www.sql2o.org/)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						```java
						public List&lt;Customer&gt; fetchCustomers(customerId) {
							try (Connection con = sql2o.open()) {
								final String query =
									"SELECT id, name, address " +
									"FROM customers WHERE id = :customerId";

								return con.createQuery(query)
									.addParameter("customerId", customerId)
									.executeAndFetch(Customer.class);
							}
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						I like the "executeAndFetch" into class, but...

						Still too much boilerplate.

						> You should NOT need to worry about a connection or even have method body.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						JDBI Example

						[jdbi.org](http://jdbi.org/)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="I actually kinda like the looks of JDBI.">
						```java
						@SqlUpdate("INSERT INTO user(id, name) VALUES (:id, :name)")
						void insertNamed(@Bind("id") int id, @Bind("name") String name);

						@SqlUpdate("INSERT INTO user(id, name) VALUES (:id, :name)")
						void insertBean(@BindBean User user);

						@SqlQuery("SELECT * FROM user ORDER BY name")
						@RegisterBeanMapper(User.class)
						List&lt;User&gt; listUsers();
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="Honestly, JDBI is the next closest one that intrigues me.">
						Getting much closer but still a little too much boilerplate.
						```java
						@RegisterBeanMapper(User.class) //this makes me cringe a bit.
						```
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						So what makes a great data layer tool?

						The absolute minimal boilerplate possible IMO.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="We have business code to port!!">
						**It should allow you to focus on your query.**

						> aka writing SQL shouldn't feel like sandpaper to your fingers.

						**It should be fun!**
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>What tools did we pick?</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown="">
						Spring Data JPA

						[baeldung.com/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-data-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-data-jpa)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data was our starter data layer.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It has some really cool abstractions.

						Really good at getting records to/from database.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data Query Examples
						```groovy
						@Query("SELECT o FROM SalesTaxRuleIdentity AS o ORDER BY o.name ASC")
						List&lt;SalesTaxRuleIdentity&gt; findAllIdentities()

						@Query('''SELECT icon FROM IconNode icon
						          WHERE icon.name LIKE CONCAT('%',?1,'%') ORDER BY icon.name ASC''')
						Page&lt;IconNode&gt; searchIconNodes(String searchText, Pageable pageable)

						@Query('''
							SELECT CASE WHEN (count(p.documentNumber) > 0)
								THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS document_number_exists
							FROM ProjectElement p WHERE p.documentNumber = ?1
						''')
						boolean documentNumberExists(String documentNumber)
						```
						Note:
						What I like?
						- Zero boilerplate
						- Your entity object is populated and the data types figured out
						- You think in terms of classes & properties (vs database columns)
						- Query validated on startup == less integration tests!

						What I don't like?
						- Hibernate under the cover. Feels icky.
						- Session Cache gets stale with non-JPA DB updates
						- Explicit flush to been by non-JPA
						- Generated SQL output is a bit ugly
						- 1 degree removed from SQL. (Normally fine, until it isn't)
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						JOOQ

						[jooq.org](https://jooq.org)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Spring Data has limits in terms of dynamic query building.

						We found JOOQ to fit that need really well.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It has a builder pattern that is really powerful.

						However, a bit non-awesome to read.

						> Spring Data is our default GOTO until the problem feels like JOOQ land.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						JOOQ Query Example
						```java
						List&lt;InventoryGroup&gt; findByParentGroupId(String parentId)  {
							return jooq.select(ID, GROUP_NAME, FULL_DISPLAY_STRING, ICON_ID, MANAGEMENT_GROUP_ID)
								.from(TABLE)
								.where(equalToOrIsNull(PARENT_GROUP_ID, parentId))
								.orderBy(ORDINAL, GROUP_NAME)
								.fetchInto(InventoryGroup)
						}
						```
						Note:
						What I like?
						- Powerful builder pattern
						- Perfect for dynamic queries
						- Fantastic re-usability
						- Solid POJO mapping abilities (can interpret @Column JPA annotations)
						- Type-safe SQL queries

						What I don't like?
						- Hard to read large queries
						- Requires a method body
						- Not new dev friendly
						- It's "generate POJO" feature. Feels icky. We don't use.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>Is it working?</section>
					<section data-markdown
							 data-notes="You can still easily have a FOR loop that calls the DB each time.">
						YES, it's been a huge success for Flex5 speed.
					</section>
					<section>
						Things we still do...
					</section>
					<section>
						We still have to watch out for database round trips.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Since we only have ID's references...

						We try to bag them up and fetch all at once, etc.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We use a SPARSE select when pulling big classes.

						We have a bunch of tables that have 100's of columns.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Sparse SELECT example
						```groovy
						@Query('''
							SELECT
							eqDef.id as id,
							eqDef.prepManifestTypeId as prepManifestTypeId,
							eqDef.prepAutoScanMode as prepAutoScanMode,
							eqDef.prepAutoScanMatchMode as prepAutoScanMatchMode,
							eqDef.autoPopulateNumberEnabled as autoPopulateNumberEnabled,
							eqDef.numberingSchemeId as numberingSchemeId,
							eqDef.numbered as numbered
							FROM EquipmentListDefinition AS eqDef
							WHERE eqDef.id = ?1
							''')
						Map findSparseByIdForPrepProcess(String definitionId)
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="We are building Flex5 cacheless.">
						> Caching is a smell if it's your first instinct.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We use recursive MySQL stored procedures.

						They help us locate id sets for parent/child relationships.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>And finally, how does our data layer translate to JSON?</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The beauty of this approach is that we have no domain/DTO translation layer.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-notes="So essential we solve SQL & JSON size with one solution.">
						The data comes out lean from the database.

						> and our entities serialize directly across the wire.
